    <string name="about">MusTrip is a tool for exploring the music of the world and for helping
        tie your own adventures with music. It uses Spotify\'s own resources to find uniquely distinct
        music to a particular city or to the nearest city from your geolocation. Because it uses
        Spotify\'s internal data on track play distributions, it supports up to 543 cities currently
        worldwide, mostly in North America and Europe. For full functionality, it requires access
        to a Spotify premium account.

        This app supports both our "Trip" experience and its "Music Finder". The Trip mode allows
        a user to find distinctly popular music around their geolocation, and creates a streaming
        playlist. The user can also examine the map and update their position to see if they are
        closer to a different city than they originally started in. \n
        The Music Finder mode allows you to type in a city name and playlists of songs that are
        distinctly unique to that city. You can hop between cities, whether it be Paris, Lisbon,
        or even San Franciso and Boston. Songs will indicate where they are "from" and just like before
        the user can interact with the playlist.

        (if there are multiple cities with the same name, also throw in the country name...) and the
        queue will load up songs popular in that area. Enjoy!

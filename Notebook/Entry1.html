App name: Synkd

Briefly explain the need for the app (the "what")
Spontaenous parties and friendly get-togethers often lack a good speaker set-up and a platform to share music easily. 
This app would allow any users to "host" a party room, in which other users with the channel's "party code" could join
in and queue up music on a shared playlist. All phones connected would have the ability to play the music as well, creating a makeshift
speaker system from a collection of phones.

List the stakeholders and customers of the apps (the "who")
High school students, college students, young professionals, 

Using wireframes, sketch the most important views of the app.

Diagram or sketch the architecture of the platform. The platform is what that powers the app. It is very difficult to build an app without any dependencies. An example is Instagram.

List and briefly describe the core functionality of the app, the most important functions and transactions of the app.

There are two key components that we foresee.

The first component is the shared queue between devices, allowing users to add to a collective queue. This
is useful for situations in which a group wishes to add or suggest music to a playlist without the restriction of it being accessible on
only a single device. 

The second component is the synchronized music playability component. This is the added feature of allowing users to combine device 
speaker capabilities to enhance the listening experience. 

List and briefly describe the secondary functionality of the app, the functions and transactions of the app that are nice to have only if time allows.
Offline mode, visualizations of the music spread across the devices, push notifications, party announcements, profile-tied playlists
and song suggestions.

List the features on a mobile device that the app will use (e.g., camera, GPS, SMS, flashlight).
Speakers, SMS/Wifi (network connectivity).

Briefly describe any limitations each team member may feel that will hold back progress.
Synchronizing time with music, working with depreciated APIs, fragmented OS, minimizing battery/resource usage. 
Briefly describe how your team plans to market or advertise the app.
Use at personal events, posts on FaceBook pages, networking.
